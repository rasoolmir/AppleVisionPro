# Project Name: Apple Vision Pro

## About the project: 

In this project, I implemented the Apple Pro Vision with five mini-projects using HTML, CSS, and JS.

My goal in doing this project is to implement and dynamically create five mini-projects using separate methods in the style of Pro Vision.

The methods I used in implementation and development include OOP, local storages, fetch API, and BEM rule.

This project lacks the following two items:
Weather API, which you need to get separately from the OpenWeatherMap.com site if necessary.
To prevent the project size from increasing, I did not include an MP3 music file.


## Description projects

### Gallery:

I call images and categorize them using a JSON file, fetch API which helps reduce code redundancy.

### Weather:

I began implementing the project by using an API obtained from a weather website.

### Notes:

I started implementing the project using OOP and local storage, which led to cleaner and more organized code. Additionally, I created the environment locally.

### Spotify and Paint:

In this project, there are also cleaner coding methods implemented for dynamic differentiation, resulting in a more dynamic implementation.
